# HUJI Introduction to Object Oriented Programming (67125)
My solutions for all the exercises for the Introduction to Object Oriented Programming (67125) of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2023-2024 Fall Semester.
Exercises 0 and 1 are omitted as I didn't participate in them.

If you're a fellow HUJI student who didn't complete the course - You're highly encouraged to exit this repository and solve everything by your own. I am in no way responsible for any outcome of using this code for your academics, whether you're HUJI student or not - Use at your own risk.
